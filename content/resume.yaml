  summary: |
    I am a product-minded full-stack engineer and technical architect. I lead
    exceptional teams in building and scaling SaaS applications that shorten time-to-value
    for customers and maximize productivity for internal stakeholders. I've designed,
    shipped, and stewarded platforms that span CLI to cloud.

    I'm passionate about delivering products that empower every role to do their
    most impactful work, from engineers to business users. I believe in async, distributed
    work and thrive in cross-functional teams. I strive to center compassion in everything
    I build.
